    "peanutStep2": "Add garlic and ginger: Add minced garlic and grated ginger. Cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly, until fragrant.",
    "peanutStep3": "Build flavor base: Stir in diced tomatoes with their juices, cumin, coriander, and cayenne pepper. Cook for 3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.",
    "peanutStep4": "Create peanut sauce: Add peanut butter and vegetable broth to the pot. Whisk vigorously until the peanut butter is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth and creamy.",
    "peanutStep5": "Cook sweet potatoes: Add cubed sweet potatoes to the stew. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer uncovered for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sweet potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork.",
    "peanutStep6": "Add greens: Stir in fresh spinach or kale and cook for 2-3 minutes until wilted. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.",
    "peanutStep7": "Serve: Ladle hot stew into bowls. Garnish with chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro. Serve with cooked rice, quinoa, or crusty bread.",
    "plantainIngredient1": "4 ripe plantains (yellow with black spots for best sweetness)",

    "plantainIngredient7": "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "plantainIngredient8": "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",
    "plantainIngredient9": "Vegetable oil for deep frying (about 3-4 cups)",
    "plantainStep1": "Prepare plantains: Peel ripe plantains. Cut them into bite-sized cubes (about 1 inch) or diagonal slices. Pieces should be uniform for even cooking.",
    "plantainStep2": "Make spice mixture: In a large bowl, combine grated ginger, finely chopped onion, cayenne pepper, paprika, ground cloves, salt, and black pepper. Mix well to create an aromatic spice blend.",
    "plantainStep3": "Marinate plantains: Add cut plantain pieces to the spice mixture. Toss gently with your hands or a spoon to coat each piece evenly with the spices. Let marinate for 10 minutes to absorb the flavors.",
    "plantainStep4": "Heat oil: Pour vegetable oil into a deep frying pan, skillet, or pot until it's about 2 inches deep. Heat over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). Test readiness by dropping in a small piece of plantain - it should immediately sizzle.",
    "plantainStep5": "Fry in batches: Carefully add plantain pieces to the hot oil in batches, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy on the edges.",
    "plantainStep6": "Drain and serve: Remove fried plantains with a slotted spoon and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve immediately while hot and crispy. Enjoy as a snack or side dish!",
    "jollofTip1": "Rice choice: Parboiled rice works best as it stays fluffy and doesn't become mushy.",
    "jollofTip2": "Spice level: Adjust cayenne pepper and scotch bonnet to your preference. Remove scotch bonnet before serving if you left it whole.",
    "jollofTip3": "Smoky flavor: For authentic party jollof, let the bottom lightly burn to achieve a smoky, crispy layer called \"socarrat\".",
    "jollofTip4": "Protein additions: Serve with grilled chicken, beef, or fish for a complete meal.",
    "jollofTip5": "Storage: Store leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Reheat gently with a splash of water.",
    "peanutTip1": "Peanut butter: Use natural peanut butter without added sugar for authentic flavor. Almond butter can be a substitute for those with nut allergies.",
    "peanutTip2": "Protein boost: Add chickpeas, black-eyed peas, or cubed tofu for extra protein.",
    "peanutTip3": "Consistency: If stew is too thick, add more broth. If too thin, simmer uncovered to reduce.",
    "peanutTip4": "Make ahead: This stew tastes even better the next day. Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 months.",
    "peanutTip5": "Spice level: Adjust cayenne pepper to your preference. Add a squeeze of lime juice for freshness.",
    "plantainTip1": "Plantain ripeness: Use ripe plantains with yellow skin and black spots for the perfect balance of sweetness. Avoid green plantains - they are too starchy for this recipe.",
    "plantainTip2": "Oil temperature: Maintaining the proper oil temperature (175°C) is crucial. Too hot and they'll burn on the outside while remaining raw inside; too cool and they'll absorb too much oil.",
    "plantainTip3": "Spice variations: Adjust cayenne pepper based on your heat tolerance. Some recipes include nutmeg or anise for additional flavor complexity.",
    "plantainTip4": "Serving suggestions: Kelewele is traditionally served as a snack with peanuts or as a side dish to grilled fish or chicken. Also great for breakfast!",
    "plantainTip5": "Storage: Best enjoyed fresh, but leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 days and reheated in the oven at 175°C for 10 minutes to restore crispiness."
